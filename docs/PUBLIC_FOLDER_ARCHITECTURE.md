# Public Folder Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The `public/` folder contains the frontend web application for the correspondence board game service. It consists of an admin console and a player interface, built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using modern web standards and Bootstrap for styling.

## Core Components

### 1. Admin Console (`index.html` + `app.js`)

**Purpose**: Administrative interface for managing games, users, and system operations.

**Key Features**:
- Dashboard with real-time statistics
- Game management (create, view, monitor)
- User management
- Game type configuration
- Database purge functionality
- Real-time updates via Socket.IO

**Architecture**:
- **Class**: `AdminPanel` - Main application controller
- **Pattern**: Single-page application with tab-based navigation
- **State Management**: Local state in class properties
- **API Communication**: RESTful calls via `fetchAPI()` method
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for live updates

**Key Methods**:
- `loadDashboard()` - Loads dashboard statistics
- `loadGames()` - Fetches and displays games with pagination
- `createGame()` - Creates new game instances
- `viewGame()` - Shows detailed game information
- `purgeDatabase()` - Cleans test data

### 2. Player Interface (`player.html` + `player.js`)

**Purpose**: Player-facing interface for joining games and making moves.

**Key Features**:
- User authentication (login/register)
- Game browsing and joining
- Interactive gameplay interface
- Move input with game-specific UIs
- Real-time game updates
- URL-based game sharing

**Architecture**:
- **Class**: `BoardGamePlayer` - Main player controller
- **Pattern**: Single-page application with section-based views
- **State Management**: LocalStorage for user persistence, class state for game data
- **Plugin System**: Game-specific logic via `GamePluginManager`
- **Layout System**: Interactive layouts for different games

**Key Methods**:
- `handleLogin()` - User authentication
- `loadAvailableGames()` - Browse joinable games
- `joinGame()` - Join game and load interface
- `submitMove()` - Submit player moves
- `loadGameLayout()` - Load game-specific interactive layouts

### 3. Game Plugin Manager (`js/GamePluginManager.js`)

**Purpose**: Manages game-specific frontend logic in a modular way.

**Architecture**:
- **Pattern**: Plugin architecture with game-type registration
- **Supported Games**: Chess, Solitaire, with fallback for unknown types
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new games by registering plugins

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Move parsing and validation
- Move formatting for display
- Game-specific UI configuration
- Input help and command references
- Move command definitions

**Plugin Interface**:
```javascript
{
  parseMove: (moveText) => moveObject,
  formatMove: (moveData) => displayString,
  getMoveInputPlaceholder: () => string,
  getMoveInputHelp: () => string,
  validateMoveFormat: (moveText) => {valid: boolean, error?: string},
  getDisplayName: () => string,
  getUIConfig: () => configObject
}
```

### 4. Interactive Layouts

#### Chess Layout (`js/layouts/ChessLayout.js`)
- **Purpose**: Interactive chess board with click-to-move functionality
- **Features**: 
  - Visual piece representation with Unicode symbols
  - Click selection and move highlighting
  - Valid move calculation and display
  - Move submission integration
  - Responsive design

#### Solitaire Layout (`js/layouts/SolitaireLayout.js`)
- **Purpose**: Interactive solitaire game interface
- **Features**:
  - Visual card representation
  - Multi-card move support
  - Drag-and-drop style interactions
  - Foundation, tableau, stock, and waste pile management
  - Mobile-optimized controls

## Design Patterns

### 1. Single Page Application (SPA)
- Both admin and player interfaces use SPA pattern
- Section-based navigation without page reloads
- URL manipulation for game persistence and sharing

### 2. Plugin Architecture
- Game-specific logic is modularized via plugins
- Easy extensibility for new game types
- Consistent interface across different games

### 3. Layout System
- Interactive game layouts replace static board images
- Game-specific UX optimizations
- Fallback to traditional board images when layouts unavailable

### 4. Real-time Communication
- Socket.IO for live game updates
- Automatic game state synchronization
- Player notifications for game events

### 5. Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with Bootstrap framework
- Touch-friendly controls for mobile devices
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes

## State Management

### Client-Side State
- **User Session**: Stored in localStorage for persistence
- **Game State**: Maintained in JavaScript classes
- **UI State**: Component-level state management

### Server Synchronization
- Real-time updates via Socket.IO
- Optimistic UI updates with server confirmation
- Error handling and rollback capabilities

## API Integration

### RESTful APIs
- Game management endpoints
- User authentication
- Move submission
- Board image generation

### Real-time Events
- `game-started` - Game begins
- `move-made` - Player makes move
- `game-update` - General game state changes

## Styling Architecture

### CSS Organization
- **Global Styles**: Bootstrap framework + custom overrides
- **Component Styles**: Scoped CSS within layout components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first breakpoints
- **Theme**: Consistent color scheme and spacing

### Style Patterns
- BEM-inspired naming for clarity
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Custom properties for theming
- Transition animations for UX enhancement

## User Experience Features

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly elements
- High contrast color schemes
- Touch target sizing

### Performance
- Lazy loading of game layouts
- Optimized image requests with size parameters
- Efficient DOM updates
- Debounced resize events

### Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly controls
- Responsive layouts
- Gesture support for game interactions
- Optimized networking for mobile connections

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Errors
- Graceful degradation for missing features
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Fallback interfaces

### Network Errors
- Connection status indicators
- Offline mode support (partial)
- Request timeout handling
- Retry strategies

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security
- No sensitive data storage in client
- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection via framework integration
- XSS prevention through proper escaping

### Communication Security
- HTTPS enforcement (handled by server)
- Authentication token management
- Real-time connection security

## Testing Strategy

### Test Pages
- `test-index.html` - Admin functionality testing
- `test-logout-button.html` - Authentication flow testing
- `test-solitaire-layout.html` - Layout system testing

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browser support (ES2015+)
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Polyfill strategy for older browsers

## Dependencies

### External Libraries
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0** - UI framework and styling
- **Bootstrap Icons** - Icon library
- **Socket.IO** - Real-time communication
- **Native APIs** - Fetch, LocalStorage, URL, etc.

### Internal Dependencies
- Backend API endpoints
- Socket.IO server implementation
- Image generation service

## Performance Characteristics

### Bundle Size
- No build process - direct file serving
- Modular loading of game-specific code
- Efficient CSS with minimal custom styles

### Runtime Performance
- DOM manipulation optimization
- Event delegation for dynamic content
- Minimal memory footprint
- Efficient state updates

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- Plugin system allows easy game additions
- Layout system supports complex interactions
- State management can scale to larger applications

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent coding patterns
- Comprehensive documentation
- Modular architecture

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a correspondence board game application while remaining flexible enough to accommodate new games and features.
